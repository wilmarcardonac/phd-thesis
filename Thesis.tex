\vspace{3mm}

This thesis focused on cosmological constraints. First, we investigated the problem of determining the fundamental causes of the universe's accelerated expansion. We studied how the presence of a non-zero dark energy anisotropic stress impacts  both the dark matter and dark energy perturbations, as well as Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) angular power spectrum. %which encompasses both internally and externally sourced anisotropic stress, that additionally allows for a scale dependence. %In particular, we have investigated how the presence of a non-zero dark energy anisotropic stress impacts both the dark matter and dark energy perturbations, as well as CMB angular power spectrum. We found approximate solutions for both dark matter and dark energy perturbations in some particular scenarios and constrained dark energy anisotropic stress parameters with recent data sets. 
%Gleaning information about cosmological parameters from all the available data sets will surely shed light on the shortcomings of the $\Lambda CDM$ model. Indeed, upcoming galaxy surveys such as Dark Energy Survey (DES), Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), Physics of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS), and EUCLID will play a key role in understanding the accelerated expansion of the universe and constraint the neutrino masses. 
%The come of new astrophysical data will make necessary very careful analyses and appropriate modelling of the statistical properties of the matter density field. In particular, since upcoming galaxy surveys will probe scales comparable to the horizon, analyses must properly include relevant relativistic effects. 
Second, we investigated the impact of neglecting lensing convergence when analysing data from a EUCLID-like survey. We showed that neglecting lensing convergence when constraining neutrino masses would lead to spurious detection of their absolute mass scale, thus hindering one of the key goals of future surveys. 
%Moreover, we found that since biases of cosmological parameters in analyses neglecting lensing might reach several standard deviations, the usual linear approximation in Fisher matrix formalisms breaks down,  therefore it might no longer be appropriate. We have then adopted a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach to yield reliable forecasts.
%Reliable, accurate, model independent measurements of the Hubble constant $H_0$ are essential to understand the physics behind the phenomenologically successful $\Lambda CDM$ model. Accurate and precise determinations of $H_0$ will make it possible to put tighter constraints on dark energy parameters and the mass of neutrinos. 
%Although direct measurements of $H_0$ have proven to be difficult (e.g., control of systematic errors, relatively small data sets, fully consistency of different methods for measuring distances), remarkable progress has been achieved over past decades; improvements include an enlarged sample of supernovae hosts having a Cepheid calibrated distance, reduction of uncertainties on anchor distances, and increase of infra-red observations of Cepheid stars. All these efforts have yielded a direct $H_0$ measurement almost as precise as the indirect determination for the $\Lambda CDM$ model derived by the Planck collaboration. 
%The group led by Adam Riess has recently found a $H_0$ value which is in a $\approx 3\sigma$ disagreement with the one derived from CMB measurements. The reasons underlying this tension are unclear (e.g., remaining CMB systematics, issues with the applied statistical methods), but if the disagreement is proved robust, this might revolutionise physics. 
Third, we developed a statistical method using Bayesian hyper-parameters to measure the Hubble constant $H_0$ with available data. The method allows a comprehensive treatment of available data sets with no need for arbitrary outlier rejection algorithms. Our best estimate of $H_0 = 73.88 \pm 2.16 \km\, \second^{-1}\, \Mpc^{-1}$ is in good agreement with previous direct measurements, but it is slightly less precise. This can be understood since our method reveals remaining inconsistencies among the data sets.
