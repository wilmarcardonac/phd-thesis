abstract = {A convincing detection of primordial non-Gaussianity in the cosmic background radiation (CMB) is essential to probe the physics of the early universe. Since a single statistical estimator can hardly be suitable to detect the various possible forms of non-Gaussianity, it is important to employ different statistical indicators to study non-Gaussianity of CMB. This has motivated the proposal of a number statistical tools, including two large-angle indicators based on skewness and kurtosis of spherical caps of CMB sky-sphere. Although suitable to detect fairly large non-Gaussianity they are unable to detect non-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds, and exhibit power spectra with undesirable oscillation pattern. Here we use several thousands simulated CMB maps to examine interrelated problems regarding advances of these spherical patches procedures. We examine whether a change in the choice of the patches could enhance the sensitivity of the procedures well enough to detect large-angle non-Gaussianity within the Planck bounds. To this end, a new statistical procedure with non-overlapping cells is proposed and its capability is established. We also study whether this new procedure is capable to smooth out the undesirable oscillation pattern in the skewness and kurtosis power spectra of the spherical caps procedure. We show that the new procedure solves this problem, making clear this unexpected power spectra pattern does not have a physical origin, but rather presumably arises from the overlapping obtained with the spherical caps approach. Finally, we make a comparative analysis of this new statistical procedure with the spherical caps routine, determine their lower bounds for non-Gaussianity detection, and make apparent their relative strength and sensitivity.},

@article{PlanckXXIII,
abstract = {The two fundamental assumptions of the standard cosmological model - that the initial fluctuations are statistically isotropic and Gaussian - are rigorously tested using maps of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropy from the Planck satellite. Deviations from isotropy have been found and demonstrated to be robust against component separation algorithm, mask choice and frequency dependence. Many of these anomalies were previously observed in the WMAP data, and are now confirmed at similar levels of significance (about 3 sigma). However, we find little evidence for non-Gaussianity, with the exception of a few statistical signatures that seem to be associated with specific anomalies. In particular, we find that the quadrupole-octopole alignment is also connected to a low observed variance of the CMB signal. A power asymmetry is now found to persist to scales corresponding to about l=600, and can be described in the low-l regime by a phenomenological dipole modulation model. However, any primordial power asymmetry is strongly scale-dependent and does not extend to arbitrarily small angular scales. Finally, it is plausible that some of these features may be reflected in the angular power spectrum of the data, which shows a deficit of power on similar scales. Indeed, when the power spectra of two hemispheres defined by a preferred direction are considered separately, one shows evidence for a deficit in power, while its opposite contains oscillations between odd and even modes that may be related to the parity violation and phase correlations also detected in the data. Although these analyses represent a step forward in building an understanding of the anomalies, a satisfactory explanation based on physically motivated models is still lacking.},

abstract = {We examine the consistency of WMAP9 and Planck data. We compare sky maps, power spectra, and inferred LCDM cosmological parameters. Residual dipoles are seen in the WMAP and Planck sky map differences, but are consistent within the uncertainties and are not large enough to explain the widely-noted differences in angular power spectra at higher l. After removing residual dipoles and galactic foregrounds, the residual difference maps exhibit a quadrupole and other large-scale systematic structure. We identify this structure as possibly originating from Planck's beam sidelobe pick-up, but note that it appears to have insignificant cosmological impact. We develop an extension of the internal linear combination technique and find features that plausibly originate in the Planck data. We examine LCDM model fits to the angular power spectra and conclude that the {\~{}}2.5{\%} difference in the spectra at multipoles greater than l{\~{}}100 are significant at the 3-5 sigma level. We revisit the analysis of WMAP's beam data and conclude that previously-derived uncertainties are robust and cannot explain the power spectrum differences. Finally, we examine the consistency of the LCDM parameters inferred from each data set taking into account the fact that both experiments observe the same sky, but cover different multipole ranges, apply different sky masks, and have different noise. While individual parameter values agree within the uncertainties, the 6 parameters taken together are discrepant at the {\~{}}6 sigma level, with chi2=56 for 6 dof (PTE = 3e-10). Of the 6 parameters, chi2 is best improved by marginalizing over Omega{\_}c h{\^{}}2, giving chi2=5.2 for 5 degrees of freedom. We find that perturbing the WMAP window function by its dominant beam error profile has little effect on Omega{\_}c h{\^{}}2, while perturbing the Planck window function by its corresponding error profile has a much greater effect on Omega{\_}c h{\^{}}2.},

@article{Bernui2014a,
abstract = {[Abridged.] It is conceivable that no single statistical estimator can be sensitive to all forms and levels of non-Gaussianity that may be present in observed CMB data. In recent works a statistical procedure based upon the calculation of the skewness and kurtosis of the patches of CMB sky-sphere has been proposed and used to find out significant large-angle deviation from Gaussianity in the foreground-reduced WMAP maps. Here we address the question as to how the analysis of Gaussianity of WMAP maps is modified if the foreground-cleaned Planck maps are used, therefore extending and complementing the previous analyses in several regards. We carry out a new analysis of Gaussianity with the available nearly full-sky foreground-cleaned Planck maps. As the foregrounds are cleaned through different component separation procedures, each of the resulting Planck maps is then tested for Gaussianity. We determine quantitatively the effects for Gaussianity of masking the foreground-cleaned Planck maps with the INPMASK, VALMASK, and U73 Planck masks. We show that although the foreground-cleaned Planck maps present significant deviation from Gaussianity of different degrees when the less severe INPMASK and VALMASK are used, they become consistent with Gaussianity as detected by our indicator {\$}S{\$} when masked with the union U73 mask. A slightly smaller consistency with Gaussianity is found when the {\$}K{\$} indicator is employed, which seems to be associated with large-angle anomalies reported by the Planck team. Finally, we examine the robustness of the Gaussianity analyses with respect to the noise pixel's as given by the Planck team, and show that no appreciable changes arise when is incorporated into the maps. The results of our analyses provide important information about the suitability of the foreground-cleaned Planck maps as Gaussian reconstructions of the CMB sky.},

@article{Fantaye2014,
abstract = {The two fundamental assumptions in cosmology are that the Universe is statistically homogeneous and isotropic when averaged on large scales. Given the big implication of these assumptions, there has been a lot of statistical tests carried out to verify their validity. Since the first high-precision Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data release by the WMAP satellite, many anomalies that challenges the isotropy assumption, including dipolar power asymmetry on large angular scales, have been reported. In this talk I will present a brief summary of the test of cosmic isotropy we carried out in the latest WMAP and Planck temperature data.},
