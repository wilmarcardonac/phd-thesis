  title = {{Determination of the Hubble Constant Using Cepheids}},
  year = {2014},
  month = {sep},
  abstract = {This paper introduces a statistical treatment to use Cepheid variable
	stars as distance indicators. The expansion rate of the Universe
	is also studied here through deriving the value of the Hubble constant
	H0. A Gaussian function approximation is proposed to fit the absolute
	magnitude and period of Cepheid variables in our galaxy. The calculations
	are carried out on samples of Cepheids observed in 23 galaxies to
	derive the distance modulus (DM) of these galaxies based on the frequency
	distributions of their periods and intrinsic apparent magnitudes.
	The DM is the difference between the apparent magnitude for extragalactic
	Cepheids and the absolute magnitude of the galactic Cepheids at maximum
	number. It is calculated by using the comparison of the period distribution
	of Cepheids in our galaxy and in other galaxies. This method is preferred
	due to its simplicity to use and its efficiency in providing reliable
	DM. A linear fit with correlation coefficient of 99.68{\%} has been
	found between the published distance modulus and that computed one
	in the present work. From the present sample, a value of H0 in the
	range of 66 to 80 +/- 5 km/s Mpc is determined. The present procedure
	of computation and its accuracy are confirmed by the high correlation
	found between our computed DM and that published in the literature.},

  title = {{Strong lensing, time delays, and the value of H{\$}{\_}0{\$}}},
  year = {2014},
  month = {aug},
  abstract = {In principle, the most straightforward method of estimating the Hubble
	constant relies on time delays between mirage images of strongly-lensed
	sources. It is a puzzle, then, that the values of H{\$}{\_}0{\$}
	obtained with this method span a range from {\$}\backslashsim 50
	- 100{\$} km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}Mpc{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}.
	Quasars monitored to measure these time delays, are multi-component
	objects. The variability may arise from different components of the
	quasar or may even originate from a jet. Misidentifying a variable
	emitting region in a jet with emission from the core region may introduce
	an error in the Hubble constant derived from a time delay. Here,
	we investigate the complex structure of sources as the underlying
	physical explanation of the wide spread in values of the Hubble constant
	based on gravitational lensing. Our Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate
	the potentially large impact of the position of the variable emitting
	region on H{\$}{\_}0{\$} determination. The derived value of the
	Hubble constant is very sensitive to the offset between the center
	of the emission and the center of the variable emitting region. Based
	on these simulations, we propose using the value of H{\$}{\_}0{\$}
	known from other techniques to spatially resolve the origin of the
	variable emission once the time delay is measured. We advocate this
	method particularly for gamma-ray astronomy, where the angular resolution
	of detectors reaches approximately 0.1 degree; lensed blazars offer
	the only route for identify the origin of gamma-ray flares. Large
	future samples of gravitationally lensed sources identified with
	Euclid, SKA, and LSST will enable a statistical determination of
	H{\$}{\_}0{\$}. The method should also provide new insights into
	the structure of the sources and their cosmic evolution at different
	energies.},

  month = {jun},
  abstract = {The determination of the Hubble constant has been a central goal in
	observational astrophysics for nearly 100 years. Extraordinary progress
	has occurred in recent years on two fronts: the cosmic distance ladder
	measurements at low redshift and cosmic microwave background (CMB)
	measurements at high redshift. The CMB is used to predict the current
	expansion rate through a best-fit cosmological model. Complementary
	progress has been made with baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) measurements
	at relatively low redshifts. While BAO data do not independently
	determine a Hubble constant, they are important for constraints on
	possible solutions and checks on cosmic consistency. A precise determination
	of the Hubble constant is of great value, but it is more important
	to compare the high and low redshift measurements to test our cosmological
	model. Significant tension would suggest either uncertainties not
	accounted for in the experimental estimates, or the discovery of
	new physics beyond the standard model of cosmology. In this paper
	we examine in detail the tension between the CMB, BAO, and cosmic
	distance ladder data sets. We find that these measurements are consistent
	within reasonable statistical expectations, and we combine them to
	determine a best-fit Hubble constant of 69.6+/-0.7 km/s/Mpc. The
	combined data constrain the Hubble constant to 1{\%}, with no compelling
	evidence for new physics.},

  abstract = {An intriguing discrepancy emerging in the concordance model of cosmology
	is the tension between the locally measured value of the Hubble rate,

	(CMB). This could be due to systematic uncertainties when measuring
	{\$}H{\_}0{\$} locally, or it could be that we live in a highly unlikely

	{\$}H{\_}0{\$} can be found by extrapolating {\$}H(z){\$} data points
	at high-{\$}z{\$} down to {\$}z=0{\$}. By doing this in a Bayesian
	non-parametric way we can find a model-independent value for {\$}H{\_}0{\$}.

	little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual

	arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties
	from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies,
	and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where
	little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is
	particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy
	formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h
	can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted
	to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little
	h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics,

	context of the 3 following questions: 1) What is required to measure
	an accurate value of H0? Given the wide range of H0 values quoted
	in the current literature, is there any evidence that the situation
	has changed very much at all in the last couple of decades? And 3),
	is a measurement of H0 accurate to 10{\%} feasible with current observational
	tools? Recent results on the extragalactic distance scale are extremely
	encouraging. A large number of independent methods (including the
	latest type Ia supernova calibration by Sandage et al. 1996) appear
	to be converging on a value of H0 in the range of 60 to 80 km/sec/Mpc.
	The factor-of-two discrepancy in H0 appears to be behind us. However,
	all of these results underscore the importance of reducing remaining
	uncertainties in the Cepheid distance scale (e.g., reddening and
	metallicity). A summary of recent results from the HST H0 Key Project
	is given. At the present time, a value of H0=73 +/- 6 (statistical)
	+/- 8 (systematic) km/sec/Mpc is obtained. This value is based on
	the Cepheid calibration of several different methods including the
	Tully-Fisher relation, type Ia supernovae, a calibration of distant
	clusters tied to the Fornax cluster, and direct Cepheid distances
	out to about 20 Mpc. The uncertainty in this estimate will decrease
	as further Cepheid calibrators become available over the course of
	the Key Project; the goal is to measure H0 to an accuracy of 10{\%}.},

	Tolman or angular size tests need to assume very strong evolution

	Ia SN studies---within the redshift range (0 < z < 1.3) that will

	data is still too large for any firm conclusions to be drawn, the

  abstract = {{The recently constructed Hubble diagram using a combined sample of
	SNLS and SDSS-II Type Ia SNe, and an application of the Alcock-Paczynski
	(AP) test using model-independent Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data,
	have suggested that the principal constraint underlying the cosmic
	expansion is the total equation-of-state of the cosmic fluid, rather
	than that of its dark energy. These studies have focused on the critical
	redshift range (0 < z < 2) within which the transition from decelerated
	to accelerated expansion is thought to have occurred, and they suggest
	that the cosmic fluid has zero active mass, consistent with a constant
	expansion rate. The evident impact of this conclusion on cosmological
	theory calls for an independent confirmation. In this paper, we carry
	out this crucial one-on-one comparison between the R{\_}h=ct Universe
	(an FRW cosmology with zero active mass) and wCDM/LCDM, using the
	latest high-z measurements of H(z). Whereas the Type Ia SNe yield
	the integrated luminosity distance, while the AP diagnostic tests
	the geometry of the Universe, the Hubble parameter directly samples
	the expansion rate itself. We find that the model-independent cosmic
	chronometer data prefer R{\_}h{\}}=ct over wCDM/LCDM with a BIC likelihood
	of {\~{}}95{\%} versus only {\~{}}5{\%}, in strong support of the
	earlier SNeIa and AP results. This contrasts with a recent analysis
	of H(z) data based solely on BAO measurements which, however, strongly
	depend on the assumed cosmology. We discuss why the latter approach
	is inappropriate for model comparisons, and emphasize again the need
	for truly model-independent observations to be used in cosmological
	tests.},

  year = {2013},
  pages = {8},
  month = {jul},
  abstract = {Recent observations have accumulated compelling evidence that some
	short gamma-ray bursts (SGRBs) are associated with the mergers of
	neutron star (NS) binaries. This would indicate that the SGRB event
	is associated with a gravitational-wave (GW) signal corresponding
	to the final inspiral of the compact binary. In addition, the radioactive
	decay of elements produced in NS binary mergers may result in transients
	visible in the optical and infrared with peak luminosities on hours-days
	timescales. Simultaneous observations of the inspiral GWs and signatures
	in the electromagnetic band may allow us to directly and independently
	determine both the luminosity distance and redshift to a binary.
	These standard sirens (the GW analog of standard candles) have the
	potential to provide an accurate measurement of the low-redshift
	Hubble flow. In addition, these systems are absolutely calibrated
	by general relativity, and therefore do not experience the same set
	of astrophysical systematics found in traditional standard candles,
	nor do the measurements rely on a distance ladder. We show that 15
	observable GW and EM events should allow the Hubble constant to be
	measured with 5{\%} precision using a network of detectors that includes
	advanced LIGO and Virgo. Measuring 30 beamed GW-SGRB events could
	constrain H{\_}0 to better than 1{\%}. When comparing to standard
	Gaussian likelihood analysis, we find that each event's non-Gaussian
	posterior in H{\_}0 helps reduce the overall measurement errors in
	H{\_}0 for an ensemble of NS binary mergers.},

	estimation of {\$}H(z){\$}, since this is sensitive to the derivative
	of the luminosity distance. The apparent tension can in fact be solved
	by correctly extrapolating {\$}H{\_}0{\$} from the low redshift supernovae
	observations by taking into account the effects of a local inhomogeneity
	on the distance redshift relation. To fully explain the difference
	we find that we need to be located in a region about {\$}45{\%}{\$}
	denser than where supernovae are located. Smaller inhomogeneities
	can still introduce important corrections to the apparent value of
	{\$}H{\_}0{\^{}}{\{}app{\}}{\$} obtained from observational data
	under the assumption of homogeneity, and need to be considered in
	the high precision cosmology era in which we are entering.},

  year = {2014},
  pages = {4},
  month = {feb},
  abstract = {We study the influence of relevant quantities, including the density
	of dark energy (DE), to the predicted Hubble outflow around a system
	of galaxies. In particular, we are interested in the difference between
	two models: 1) The standard {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM model, with
	the everywhere constant DE density, and 2) the "Swiss cheese model",
	where the universe is as old as the standard model, but the DE density
	is zero on short scales, including the environment of the system.
	We calculate the current predicted outflow patterns of dwarf galaxies
	around the Local Group-like system, using different values for the
	mass of the group, the local dark energy density, and the time of
	ejection of the dwarf galaxies, treated as test particles. These
	results are compared with the observed Hubble flow around the Local
	Group. The predicted distance-velocity relations around galaxy groups
	are not alone very sensitive indicators of the dark energy density,
	due to the obsevational scatter and the uncertainties caused by the
	used mass of the group and a range in the ejection times. In general,
	the Local Group outflow data are in agreement with the local DE density
	being equal to the global one, if the mass is about {\$}4 \backslashtimes
	10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}; a lower mass
	of about {\$}2 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}
	or less could suggest a zero local DE density. The dependence of
	the inferred DE density on the mass is a handicap in this and other
	common dynamical methods. This emphasizes the need to use different
	approaches together, for constraining the local dark energy density.},

  year = {2014},
  month = {mar},
  abstract = {We use cosmology-independent measurements of the expansion history
	in the redshift range 0.1 < z <1.2 and compare them with the Cosmic
	Microwave Background-derived expansion history predictions. The motivation
	is to investigate if the tension between the local (cosmology independent)
	Hubble constant H0 value and the Planck-derived H0 is also present
	at other redshifts. We conclude that there is no tension between
	Planck and cosmology independent-measurements of the Hubble parameter
	H(z) at 0.1 < z < 1.2 for the LCDM model (odds of tension are only
	1:15, statistically not significant). Considering extensions of the
	LCDM model does not improve these odds (actually makes them worse),
	thus favouring the simpler model over its extensions. On the other
	hand the H(z) data are also not in tension with the local H0 measurements
	but the combination of all three data-sets shows a highly significant
	tension (odds {\~{}} 1:400). Thus the new data deepen the mystery
	of the mismatch between Planck and local H0 measurements, and cannot
	univocally determine wether it is an effect localised at a particular
	redshift. Having said this, we find that assuming the NGC4258 maser
	distance as the correct anchor for H0, brings the odds to comfortable
	values. Further, using only the expansion history measurements we
	constrain, within the LCDM model, H0 = 68.5 +- 3.5 and Omega{\_}m
	= 0.32 +- 0.05 without relying on any CMB prior. We also address
	the question of how smooth the expansion history of the universe
	is given the cosmology independent data and conclude that there is
	no evidence for deviations from smoothness on the expansion history,
	neither variations with time in the value of the equation of state
	of dark energy.},

  title = {{Hubble flow variance and the cosmic rest frame}},
  year = {2012},
  pages = {37},
  month = {jan},
  abstract = {We characterize the radial and angular variance of the Hubble flow
	in the COMPOSITE sample of 4534 galaxies, on scales in which much
	of the flow is in the nonlinear regime. Independent of any cosmological
	assumptions other than the existence of a suitably averaged linear
	Hubble law, we find with decisive Bayesian evidence (ln B >> 5) that
	the Hubble constant averaged in spherical radial shells is closer
	to its asymptotic value when referred to the rest frame of the Local
	Group rather than the standard rest frame of the Cosmic Microwave
	Background (CMB). Angular averages reveal a dipole structure in the
	Hubble flow, whose amplitude in the two rest frames changes in correlation
	with the monopole variation within spheres of radius 30/h - 62/h
	Mpc in markedly different ways, with 99.99{\%} confidence. The angular
	map of Hubble flow variation is found to coincide with that of the
	residual CMB temperature dipole in the Local Group rest frame, with
	correlation coefficient -0.92. The combined results of the monopole
	and dipole variations do not support the standard kinematic interpretation
	of the motion of the Local Group in response to the clustering dipole,
	but are consistent with a foreground non-kinematic anisotropy in
	the distance-redshift relation of 0.5{\%} on scales up to 65/h Mpc.
	Effectively, the differential expansion of space produced by nearby
	nonlinear structures of local voids and denser walls and filaments
	cannot be reduced to a local boost. This hypothesis suggests a reinterpretation
	of bulk flows, which may potentially impact on calibration of supernovae
	distances, anomalies associated with large angles in the CMB anisotropy
	spectrum, and the dark flow inferred from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
	effect. It is consistent with recent studies that find evidence for
	a non-kinematic dipole in the distribution of distant radio sources.},

  title = {{A New Method for Measuring Extragalactic Distances}},
  year = {2014},
  pages = {5},

  abstract = {We have pioneered a new method for the measurement of extragalactic
	distances. This method uses the time-lag between variations in the
	short wavelength and long wavelength light from an active galactic
	nucleus (AGN), based on a quantitative physical model of dust reverberation
	that relates the time-lag to the absolute luminosity of the AGN.
	We use the large homogeneous data set from intensive monitoring observations
	in optical and near-infrared wavelength bands with the dedicated
	2-m MAGNUM telescope to obtain the distances to 17 AGNs in the redshift
	range z=0.0024 to z=0.0353. These distance measurements are compared
	with distances measured using Cepheid variable stars, and are used
	to infer that H{\_}0= 73 +- 3 (random) km/s/Mpc. The systematic error
	in H{\_}0 is examined, and the uncertainty in the size distribution
	of dust grains is the largest source of the systematic error, which
	is much reduced for a sample of AGNs for which their parameter values
	in the model of dust reverberation are individually measured. This
	AGN time-lag method can be used beyond 30 Mpc, the farthest distance
	reached by extragalactic Cepheids, and can be extended to high-redshift
	quasi-stellar objects.},
